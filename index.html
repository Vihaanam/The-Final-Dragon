        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pterosaurs existed in the Mesozoic from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous period. They had wings made out of a sort of a membrane of muscles, skin and tissues. They were the first vertebrates to fly,” explained Doctor Burrow, the renowned archaeologist. He was very keen on finding more pterosaur fossils, especially pterodactyls. “Sir, I have heard a lot about pterodactyls. What are they?” asked a student. “They are minor pterosaurs. They were not of great importance during that time. But they are important now. They were early reptiles, during the late Jurassic. The gigantic pteranodons lived after that, in the late Cretaceous. They were the minor pterosaurs, as I said, living amongst small pterosaurs, like the Rhamphorhynchus,” replied Doctor Burrow. That student was Jim Steel.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Steel was just a student with three friends, cousins Steve and John Tine, not to forget Hendor Drim. “It will definitely be a pleasure to see a real life dragon,” suggested John, as the four were sitting on an old risen tree root in the park. “Dragons aren’t real,” replied Jim, in a hurry to correct him. “Okay! I understood what you are trying to tell me. There were pterosaurs. They definitely weren’t dragons and pterosaurs are extinct. Am I right?” asked John. “Yes. You are right,” answered Jim.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve was the kind of person who would stay quiet, even in the most dangerous situations possible. He would just do what it was like him to do like opening a cupboard that was slammed shut and wasn’t opening. What he liked were situations related to mechanics. “What do you think, Steve?” asked John. “Well, you could make a fake mechanical dragon or a pterosaur,” said Steve. “Why do you always talk about mechanics?” asked John. Steve just shrugged in reply. “Robots have mechanics along with software and electricity. Electricity is my line. Software is Hendor’s, Right?” said John. “Yes,” replied Hendor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendor was the technical person. He was extremely good at software engineering. His day didn’t end without doing one part of software. One good thing about him was that he was a helping hand in ever project (the four made the projects together). A software is needed for robotics as mentioned by John. John was the master of electricity. He made a blocking oscillator without anyone’s help at the age of eight! Electric circuits wouldn’t work without him touching them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bavaria, the place where the first pterodactyl fossil was found. Doctor Burrow was sure to seize the opportunity to visit it. Jim was willing to impress him by finding a pterodactyl fossil before him. “Friends, we are going to Bavaria,” shouted Jim. “How?” asked John. “We are going to trick our teacher.” Jim and the others were going to Doctor Burrow’s archaeology classes for over a month and this was Jim’s chance to shine. “We will ask for a vacation to Germany without telling that we are leaving for Bavaria,” continued Jim. “Do you know how far Bavaria is?” joked Hendor. “I know that it is far away. We will go there by plane. It is the fastest way and you’ll have to accept that fact.”</p>
        <br>
        <div class="container">

        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHIRRRRR! The plane had started. The ticket was booked for Bavaria without going via anything. It was a direct flight. “Are you sure that we will find the pterodactyl fossil?” asked Steve softly. “Not so sure,” whispered back Jim. The flight was a menace. John lost his spare motor between the flight. “Someone, can you just pass me a spare motor,” said John, a bit too loudly. A crowd of people told him to quiet down. The rest of them placed their hands on their ears. Some people had worn headphones and didn’t hear the commotion. Some sleeping people got up and others were still sleeping because they were deep sleepers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another time, Hendor’s laptop slipped from his hand. One sleeping person woke up with such a jerk that his neck probably broke. Hendor, on the other hand was grumpy for the rest of the flight because his laptop could be shared between three people and none could use it because it had literally split in three! Once, Steve realized that his tissue was missing. After wiggling like a worm for half an hour, he found it inside his pocket.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am tired of the commotion you are creating,” whispered Jim. “Sorry, but how are we supposed to know that my spare motor is missing,” whispered back John. “Don’t start with all that again,” warned Hendor. “Okay,” said John. Just then, the plane started having jerks. It was as if they were stuck in a storm and it wasn’t even dark outside! Then, the plane started heating. The ceiling became red hot. It was probably the end. Then the heat resided. The turbulence went. It was not the end. “Don’t worry. Whatever happened has gone. If anyone is having problems with breathing, pull down the oxygen masks,” came the pilot’s voice from the speakers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Whatever that was, it was dangerous,” whispered Steve. Then, Jim spotted a gigantic red bird coming from above the plane. It had large wings, an enormous wing span. “What is that?” asked Jim. “What is what?” questioned Hendor. By then, the bird had gone. The flight was delayed, they were supposed to reach Bavaria by then. After a while, they all saw the castle of Bavaria, the Neuschwanstein castle.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We have reached Bavaria. Please do not close the window shutters,” announced the pilot. The plane had landed. It was evening, an odd time to travel by plane. But, Jim couldn’t blame himself. He was just wondering what the red bird was. It could have been a common bird which’s species was restricted to Bavaria. There were multiple possibilities. But, he didn’t know any giant bird the size of an aeroplane which was red and strong enough to shake an aeroplane. In fact, he didn’t know any bird the size of an aeroplane. Even the pterosaurs weren’t so big.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four of them stayed at a house on rent. “How is the house?” asked John. “Great,” whispered Jim. John was now worried and asked, “What’s happened?” Jim recounted his experience but the three looked confused. “You could have seen a plane shaped like a bird,” said Steve. “A plane that flaps its wings?” questioned Jim and Steve once again began thinking. They arranged all their belongings for the stay. By then it was dinner time. Hendor knew the way and took them all to a restaurant which was nearby. “Tasty food. We should come here often,” said Jim who’s mood was great now. “Tomorrow, we will leave for the site,” said Steve. The next day, the four left for the site. “Let’s start digging. We may find the fossils at a less rocky area,” said Jim. They actually found a soft area. “Here?” questioned John. “Maybe,” replied Jim.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John started digging. He kept on digging. He dug and dug and dug and dug. Then, KNOCK! “I have found something…” The three came and helped him dig on the sides. They saw something red. Then, Jim started seeing blotches. Their size was growing and growing and he fell down, his head throbbing with pain. “Oh!” yelled Steve. The rest left their work and came to look at him. His head had gone red. “Jim, what happened,” asked Hendor. A few minutes later, Jim got up. A blurred sight was in front of him. Blobs and lines were coming on the clear image. John turned around and he saw an unexpected thing in the pit, nothing! Even the red scaly thing was gone now! “There’s nothing here!” shouted John. “What! That is impossible” said Hendor, still looking at Jim. “Have a look,” said John. Hendor looked in. “You’re right! There is nothing here!” exclaimed Hendor. Even Steve came. He disbelieved his eyes and kept staring at the hole as if a fossil was going to pop out of it in a burst of sand.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim was taken to the hospital. The cause was unknown by then. In a day, Jim was fit and fine. They doctors said that Jim had an internal injury and he fell because of that. When Jim came, he had a bandage on his neck and head and leg. How he got hurt at so many places was unknown. It was said that he had some brain damage. It was true! He had memory loss! Loss of memory can be serious if it is permanent. It was! “Hi John,” he said to John. This was not memory loss. “Where are we?” he asked. “In a hospital at Bavaria,” said John. “I don’t live in Bavaria,” said Jim. This was memory loss. Overall, he had short-term memory loss. This was no problem.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <img height="300" src="scale.png">
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the digging had started again. Jim had to be kept in complete bedrest. So, John, Steve and Hendor were the only ones digging. They dug and dug when the ground fell to a vast hole. Suddenly, Jim came walking towards them. “What are you doing here? I told you to stay home,” said John, frustrated. “Sorry, I was just hungry. Where is the food,” replied Jim. John looked at the clock. It was 11 in the morning. “At 11?” questioned John. “I thought it was 12. Sorry to disturb,” replied Jim. He walked a few centimetres and then turned around. “Is it 11 or 12?” he asked. “11,” replied Hendor, getting bored of what was happening.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the hole disappeared. It seemed to be coming up. It was rising and rising. Steve shook John’s arm. John too looked behind. It was really rising. Hendor followed. Something red was there. Thud! The noise had not come from there. John, looked behind. It was Jim, fallen on the ground. Hendor ran towards him. “Jim w… w… wake up,” he said in a hurry. Jim got up. “Why am I lying down?” he asked. “Because you have fallen,” said Hendor, ignorantly. SWISH! “Hendor!” yelled John. A handful of sand blew away. Or was it a mouthful? A wing was revealed. Hendor ran back to the hole and Steve went towards Jim. “A wing?” questioned Hendor. It was large and had what seemed like tiny holes in it. It was covered on the top with scales of a dull red colour. Jim got up. “Sit down!” ordered John from behind. “What about the…” asked Jim. “What about your memory loss?” interrupted John. “It doesn’t seem like I have memory loss,” said Jim. “Are you confident?” questioned Hendor. “Yes” said Jim. “Then, come here,” said Hendor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Please dig,” said Jim. They dug and dug revealing a body covered in dull red scales. “Is it a fossil,” asked Hendor. It was like a bird but gigantic. “No,” said Jim. It had wings like hundreds of kites joined together. “It is alive?” questioned John. Its chest was pulsing. “Yes,” replied Jim, placing a hand on its chest. It had wings like a pterodactyl. “Is it a pteranodon?” asked Steve. It had wing emerging from its back. “No, it has wings from the back, though it is the right size. It doesn’t have the cartilaginous spike on the head,” replied Jim. It was moving. “Is it a mechanical,” asked Steve. Jim carefully took a knife and pierced the skin. The skin slowly regenerated. “No, I think that we have a dragon at our hand. The final dragon,” said Jim. SWISH! One eyelid opened. CAAAAAAAAAACK! The dragon screeched. It jumped up and disappeared in a ball of fire. “Yes, it is a dragon,” said John.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four followed the dragon. CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK! This was a longer screech. A crowd of people was watching them as they were running after the dragon. Groups of people were standing on the balcony of their top floor. Nobody had seen a dragon. The dragon had lived amidst them for years but its cover was uncovered and it was seen flying for the first time amidst people. “Catch it!” yelled Hendor. “How are we supposed to catch it? It is flying faster than us. We are just running without anything to catch it with. Even, the bike is forgotten at Doctor Burrow’s. The rest is at the beach,” said John. “I agree,” said Steve and stopped running. “Me too,” said Jim and stopped. He was followed by John and finally Hendor. “Wow! That dragon was huge,” said Hendor. A group of people came towards them. They had forgotten that they all were in a crowd! “I am tired,” groaned Jim. “Let’s go back to the house,” said Hendor. As soon as they entered, the four were lying inside their rooms on their respective beds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, SCREEEEEEEEEEEEECH! “Huh!” said John as he woke up. The dragon was on his window. The dragon showed his claw. “Help!”</p>
