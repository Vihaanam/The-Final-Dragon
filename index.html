        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Pterosaurs existed in the Mesozoic from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous period. They had wings made out of a sort of a membrane of muscles, skin and tissues. They were the first vertebrates to fly,” explained Doctor Burrow, the renowned archaeologist. He was very keen on finding more pterosaur fossils, especially pterodactyls. “Sir, I have heard a lot about pterodactyls. What are they?” asked a student. “They are minor pterosaurs. They were not of great importance during that time. But they are important now. They were early reptiles, during the late Jurassic. The gigantic pteranodons lived after that, in the late Cretaceous. They were the minor pterosaurs, as I said, living amongst small pterosaurs, like the Rhamphorhynchus,” replied Doctor Burrow. That student was Jim Steel.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim Steel was just a student with three friends, cousins Steve and John Tine, not to forget Hendor Drim. “It will definitely be a pleasure to see a real life dragon,” suggested John, as the four were sitting on an old risen tree root in the park. “Dragons aren’t real,” replied Jim, in a hurry to correct him. “Okay! I understood what you are trying to tell me. There were pterosaurs. They definitely weren’t dragons and pterosaurs are extinct. Am I right?” asked John. “Yes. You are right,” answered Jim.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve was the kind of person who would stay quiet, even in the most dangerous situations possible. He would just do what it was like him to do like opening a cupboard that was slammed shut and wasn’t opening. What he liked were situations related to mechanics. “What do you think, Steve?” asked John. “Well, you could make a fake mechanical dragon or a pterosaur,” said Steve. “Why do you always talk about mechanics?” asked John. Steve just shrugged in reply. “Robots have mechanics along with software and electricity. Electricity is my line. Software is Hendor’s, Right?” said John. “Yes,” replied Hendor.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hendor was the technical person. He was extremely good at software engineering. His day didn’t end without doing one part of software. One good thing about him was that he was a helping hand in ever project (the four made the projects together). A software is needed for robotics as mentioned by John. John was the master of electricity. He made a blocking oscillator without anyone’s help at the age of eight! Electric circuits wouldn’t work without him touching them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bavaria, the place where the first pterodactyl fossil was found. Doctor Burrow was sure to seize the opportunity to visit it. Jim was willing to impress him by finding a pterodactyl fossil before him. “Friends, we are going to Bavaria,” shouted Jim. “How?” asked John. “We are going to trick our teacher.” Jim and the others were going to Doctor Burrow’s archaeology classes for over a month and this was Jim’s chance to shine. “We will ask for a vacation to Germany without telling that we are leaving for Bavaria,” continued Jim. “Do you know how far Bavaria is?” joked Hendor. “I know that it is far away. We will go there by plane. It is the fastest way and you’ll have to accept that fact.”</p>
        <br>
        <div class="container">

        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHIRRRRR! The plane had started. The ticket was booked for Bavaria without going via anything. It was a direct flight. “Are you sure that we will find the pterodactyl fossil?” asked Steve softly. “Not so sure,” whispered back Jim. The flight was a menace. John lost his spare motor between the flight. “Someone, can you just pass me a spare motor,” said John, a bit too loudly. A crowd of people told him to quiet down. The rest of them placed their hands on their ears. Some people had worn headphones and didn’t hear the commotion. Some sleeping people got up and others were still sleeping because they were deep sleepers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another time, Hendor’s laptop slipped from his hand. One sleeping person woke up with such a jerk that his neck probably broke. Hendor, on the other hand was grumpy for the rest of the flight because his laptop could be shared between three people and none could use it because it had literally split in three! Once, Steve realized that his tissue was missing. After wiggling like a worm for half an hour, he found it inside his pocket.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am tired of the commotion you are creating,” whispered Jim. “Sorry, but how are we supposed to know that my spare motor is missing,” whispered back John. “Don’t start with all that again,” warned Hendor. “Okay,” said John. Just then, the plane started having jerks. It was as if they were stuck in a storm and it wasn’t even dark outside! Then, the plane started heating. The ceiling became red hot. It was probably the end. Then the heat resided. The turbulence went. It was not the end. “Don’t worry. Whatever happened has gone. If anyone is having problems with breathing, pull down the oxygen masks,” came the captain’s voice from the speakers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Whatever that was, it was dangerous,” whispered Steve. Then, Jim spotted a gigantic red bird coming from above the plane. It had large wings, an enormous wing span. “What is that?” asked Jim. “What is what?” questioned Hendor. By then, the bird had gone. The flight was delayed, they were supposed to reach Bavaria by then. After a while, they all saw the castle of Bavaria, the Neuschwanstein castle.</p>
